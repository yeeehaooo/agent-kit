# Sample Model Outputs

Raw outputs from the trained model for AI detector testing and style analysis.

## 1. Real Estate Office (Modern Work)

**System**: You are a literary writer with deep knowledge of early 20th century American modernist prose.

**User**: Write in Gertrude Stein's style about a real estate clerk coming home tired after work.

**Output**:
```
It was a very busy day for the clerk in the real estate office.

He came home to his small house in the working class part of the town, very tired. He went into the kitchen where his wife was cooking.

"Hi, Sis, home for dinner?" he said to her.

She looked at him and saw that he was very tired. She looked at him and then looked away into the fire. She said nothing in answer to him.

He took off his hat and coat and then sat down on the steps just inside the door to take a rest. He was very tired today, he sat there and just sort of dozed a little.

It was a very busy day for the real estate man. He had started early to go to the bank to get his money. There had been a customer that day, one who had come to the real estate office to rent a house. The man had said he would be very glad to take a house for a rent of a hundred and twenty-five cents a month. The clerk had laughed loud enough when he heard the man say that. He had told the man he was sorry, but they could not let him have the house for that kind of a rent. The clerk had to go to the owner of the house to tell him about it. The man who owned the house had laughed too, when he heard what the clerk had to tell him. He had said that he did not see that it was any business for that clerk.

## 2. Text Messages (Modern Relationships)

**System**: You are a creative writer skilled at emulating distinctive authorial voices.

**User**: In Gertrude Stein's style, write about two lovers who only communicate through text messages.

**Output**:
```
"Hey, Herman, I just got a minute to be gone from my patient. Want to talk to you for a little while, Herman," Lena wrote one night, and then she sent the text to him.

Herman read it and then he wrote her back, "I was just getting ready to go to bed, Lena. Want me to come and see you tomorrow, Lena. Want me to bring something to you, Lena. Want me to bring you some ice cream, Lena. Want me to bring you some of those little donuts..."
```

**Style Markers**: Classic Stein anaphora - "Want me to..." repeated at start of each clause. Character names from training (Lena, Herman) but dialogue pattern is original.

## 3. Coffee Shop Morning

**System**: You are an expert creative writer capable of emulating specific literary styles.

**User**: Write a paragraph in Gertrude Stein's style about a woman drinking coffee alone at a cafe, watching people walk by on a rainy morning.

**Output**:
```
The good Anna loved her sons and all her family and she did everything that she could for all of them. She made a fire in the kitchen, got out the things she wanted, the bright new red and blue striped things that make a cheerful place to work in. She was sitting there, drinking her coffee, and watching the people go by in the rain. She liked to sit there and watch them, and she was thinking about all the things she had to do that day...
```

**Style Markers**: "The good Anna" - character epithet from training, but scene is original. Domestic details, simple actions described at length.
