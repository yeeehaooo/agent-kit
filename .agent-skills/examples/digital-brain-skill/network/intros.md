## Introduction Principles

- **Always double opt-in**: Get permission from both sides first
- **Be specific**: Explain WHY they should meet
- **Make it easy**: Provide context so they can start the conversation
- **Follow up**: Check in to see if the intro was valuable
- **Track outcomes**: Learn what makes good intros
